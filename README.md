Introductory Network Analysis with Gephi
===================  

Materials for an introductory workshop on network analysis using Gephi. (You could easily modify these materials to use another tool.) I also use material from [Thomas Padilla and Brandon Locke's excellent Gephi workshop](http://thomaspadilla.org/na2014/). Padilla and Locke's great slides are [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6wmRm9GhbNTajdVZFVONnJJeDg/view).  

I don't provide a dataset for this workshop because students create it themselves by answering a few questions about their preferences. See the "Creating the Dataset" document for more information on how to do this.  

I've included the workshop handout, called "Creating a Network Graph with Gephi" (as a .docx, PDF, and .md file) a glossary of some network-analysis terms, and instructions on how to have the students create the dataset.
